amathema - LaTeX equations as PNG
=================================
GET /m/#{encoded equation}.png where equation is a Base64 for URL (+ to -, / to _) encoded  LaTeX equation (e.g. [equation].pack('m').tr('+/','-_').strip)

Some configuration at the top of amathema.rb, self explanatory.

Default is listening on port 2804, localhost only.

Only expose this to untrusted input if you trust your latex setup (in particular check the shell_execute and input/ouput file options of your tex distribution).
